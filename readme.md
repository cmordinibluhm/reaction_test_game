# Reaction Test Game 

This is a project completed during UCLA's Electronics for Physics Measurement course (physics 117). 

The game is simple. Player 1 presses their button and the clock starts. Player 2 presses their button  
as quickly as they can after Player 1. The game is reset by holding down both buttons for 1 second. 

A short demo of the game can be seen below. The game is started and stopped several times and then reset.
